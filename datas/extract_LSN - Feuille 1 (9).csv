➡️ Des accompagnements 100 % activables, alliant pédagogie, transformation digitale et intelligence artificielle.

Notre conviction est simple :
 👉 Transmettre, c’est faire vivre une expérience.

Pour un formateur, cela signifie animer autrement, en s’appuyant sur les principes fondateurs de la pédagogie active, enrichie par les outils numériques et l’IA.

Pour une structure, cela veut dire digitaliser ses pratiques sans déshumaniser, afin de rendre l’expérience pédagogique et commerciale plus fluide, cohérente et impactante.

Trois contextes, un même objectif : réussir dans la formation.

1️⃣ Futur formateur ?
Pour vous lancer rapidement.
Formez-vous à définir votre offre, mettre en place vos outils essentiels et lancer vos premières actions pour décrocher vos premiers clients.

2️⃣ Déjà formateur ?
Pour développer votre activité.
Formez-vous à optimiser votre modèle, digitaliser vos processus, piloter votre activité avec méthode et à l'aide de l'IA pour passer à la vitesse supérieure.

3️⃣ Structure établie ?
Pour booster votre performance.
Formez vos équipes à digitaliser vos parcours pédagogiques, renforcer vos pratiques et déployer des stratégies commerciales adaptées.

➡️ Des parcours de formation 100 % activables :
Toutes nos formations sont pensées pour être concrètes, finançables et immédiatement utiles, avec un fil conducteur : tirer parti du digital et de l’intelligence artificielle pour renforcer vos pratiques pédagogiques et commerciales.

➡️ Une démarche sérieuse :

Planifiez un entretien découverte : en 30 minutes, on fait le point ensemble sur votre projet.",Professional Training and Coaching,"Aujourd’hui, je partage mon temps entre deux missions complémentaires : 1️⃣ Former → marketing, transformation digitale, IA et stratégie numérique. 2️⃣ Entreprendre → avec Turquoise Academy, au service des acteurs de la formation. Transmettre, c’est faire vivre une expérience. C’est ce qui me guide depuis que j’ai quitté le monde des agences pour celui de la formation. Après vingt ans à concevoir des stratégies de marketing digital, j’ai voulu partager autrement. Je suis devenu formateur, puis responsable pédagogique, en accompagnant des publics très variés - étudiants, salariés, dirigeants. J’ai formé plus de 5 000 apprenants, conçu des parcours hybrides, digitalisé mes contenus et obtenu la certification Qualiopi. Au fil des années, j’ai développé une approche qui me ressemble : concrète, engageante et amplifiée par le numérique et l’IA. Une pédagogie active, où l’on apprend en expérimentant et en donnant du sens. --------------- 🌐 C’est dans cette dynamique qu’est née Turquoise Academy, un projet à la croisée de deux passions : la transmission et le numérique. L’intelligence artificielle bouleverse nos métiers. Transmettre comme avant, c’est déjà être en retard. Turquoise Academy est née d’une conviction : 👉 On peut améliorer la performance sans perdre le sens. 👉 On peut intégrer l’IA et l’automatisation tout en gardant l’humain au cœur de l’apprentissage. L’ambition : accompagner les formateurs et les structures éducatives qui veulent créer, structurer ou faire évoluer leur activité à l’ère de l’intelligence artificielle - avec des approches concrètes, activables et profondément humaines. --------------------------- 📩 Vous partagez ces enjeux ? Vous cherchez un formateur, un intervenant ou un partenaire pour digitaliser vos pratiques ?

We believe that spaces we live in shape who we are and who we become.

Founded and led by Louis Le Bras.",Interior Design,"Rosetta Donzelli was my great-grandmother.  A Sicilian merchant, forced to leave her country due to local political reasons.  She had to rebuild her life elsewhere, many times.  With, as her only wealth and life lesson, her ability to choose — the right objects, the right people, the right places. This heritage truly marked me: Since the age of 3, I have spent one month every year in Italy. There, through my family and my roots, I discovered the taste for things that last: objects passed down, inhabited places, repeated gestures. This heritage shaped me.  It became, without me really realizing it, a guiding thread in my life, a way of looking at the world: searching for what has meaning, what endures, what connects people to the places they inhabit. What amazes them. What sparks a light in their eyes during an experience or a moment in life. Today, I carry this vision forward through Donzelli: a curatorial platform that connects furniture, places & people. After starting my career in design and digital agencies in Paris and several years running my own practice, I now want to orchestrate a new chapter for my grandmother’s name. A living, independent index that highlights pieces, designers, and spaces that embody taste, proportions, and volumes that make spaces beautiful and pleasant to live in. I build Donzelli as Rosetta would have seen it: a meeting place between objects, places, and people who give them meaning. Beyond inspiration, I am building Donzelli to restore meaning and depth to the spaces in which we live. They shape who we are and who we become. It is essential to take care of them. The environment is a key to our success. It is time to put an end to cold catalogs and impersonal, insignificant digital experiences. We work in an industry that should inspire people the most — to surpass themselves, to feel at their best, through places that mark their lives. It is up to us to give them the means to do so.",,,3,Louis Le Bras,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEcnd8_2HcrRw/company-logo_400_400/company-logo_400_400/0/1727863675717/ecv_paris_logo?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=pLF6hEIVhyq8OqW8f384bNNUHbZYEYxBcZGxfagy0pU,,,,,"Paris, France",,2025-10-14,,

At the same time there is a voice inside me telling me that 50 is the time to manage my way out. The meeting ends and I hear myself announcing it is time for me to move on to a new life and retire. In all serenity!    A few months later my new life is starting. It’s time to structure the project I have had in mind for years - combine my professional skills with my passion for the mountains and skiing. Hours of reflection later it’s decided - I will help clients find their mountain property and organize high end experiences for them.  Sounds great but what do I know about real estate? Not much. The only way to look credible is to go and learn! Let’s invest and go back to school. After months of hard work and studying I get the exam’s results. I passed and will get my real estate brokerage diploma. I shed a tear. I made it! At the same time I keep building the business and get asked by a good friend if I am interested to help start the rental business of their luxury chalet complex in Chamonix. I hesitate but simultaneously realise it’s the missing piece of my project. And so we start. New experiences and more to learn. Exciting! PB & CO is born and getting experience and opportunities.
